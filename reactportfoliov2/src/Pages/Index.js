                <p>
                My name is Timothy Kuebler and I am a student at UCF for the Coding Bootcamp. 
                Outside of coding I enjoy anything dealing with cars as well as playing guitar and going to concerts. 
                Please follow the tab called "Portfolio" to see my working Portfolio of the material I've covered in my Coding Bootcamp.
